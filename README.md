<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:17px;">Spin-Up is a competitive game played on a 12' by 12' field, featuring two teams, each consisting of two robots. One robot must fit within a 15" by 15" by 15" space, and the other within an 18" by 18" by 18" space. The objective is to score more points than the opposing team within the allotted time: a 45-second autonomous period followed by a 1:15-minute driver-controlled period.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Colored Rollers: Positioned at the edges of the field, these are worth 10 points to the alliance color showing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Endgame Period: During the final 30 seconds of the match, teams earn 2 points for each tile a robot is touching. There are 28 scorable tiles, excluding the alliance scoring sectioned off by the colored bracketszones.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
